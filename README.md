PICOLED RGB LED Breakout
========

LEDs are the bacon of PCB design… they spice-up FR4 like a boss! 

Getting familiar with the characteristics of a component is always a challenge. Through-hole components are easy enough - slap them in a breadboard and you're done. With components like the SMLP36 series PICOLED RGB LED from ROHM, it's a bit more challenging.

So... here is a breakout to ease the pain. Have fun!

##NOTE
If you’re thinking you can hand solder one of these – it might be easier to suck peanut butter through a coffee straw. Hot air or reflow is going to be the tool of choice. I can’t imagine you would need more than a spec of solder paste on each of those microscopic pads.
